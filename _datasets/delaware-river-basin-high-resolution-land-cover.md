notes: "High-resolution land cover dataset for the Delaware River Basin developed\
  \ by the UVM Spatial Analysis Lab. The primary data sources were 2006-2008 leaf-off\
  \ LiDAR data, 2005-2008 leaf-off orthoimagery, and 2013 leaf-on orthoimagery. Ancillary\
  \ data sources such as LiDAR-derived breaklines for roads and hydrology were also\
  \ used to augment the land-cover mapping. Land cover class assignment was done using\
  \ a rule-based expert system embedded within an object-based framework. Land cover\
  \ classes include:\r\nLand cover class\r\n0 - Background\r\n1 - Water\r\n2 - Emergent\
  \ Wetlands\r\n3 - Tree Canopy\r\n4 - Scrub/Shrub\r\n5 - Low Vegetation\r\n6 - Barren\r\
  \n7 - Structures\r\n8 - Other Impervious Surfaces\r\n9 - Roads\r\n10 - Tree Canopy\
  \ over Structures\r\n11 - Tree Canopy over Other Impervious Surfaces\r\n12 - Tree\
  \ Canopy over Roads\r\n\r\nUVM Spatial Analysis Lab request attribution in any publications,\
  \ reports, derivative datasets, etc."

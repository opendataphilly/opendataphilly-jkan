notes: PhilaPlace is an online interactive database of both contemporary and historical
  multimedia record, including personal/neighborhood stories, photography, and video,
  of individuals and communities in the Old Southwark and Greater Northern Liberties
  Areas. Users can search locations (neighborhoods, streets) and set thematic parameters
  to learn more about events, businesses and people who were memorable to the different
  communities. Entries in the database are visualized as feature markers in an interactive
  map tool, accompanying the search.  PhilaPlace was developed by the Historical Society
  of Pennsylvania.

notes: 'The PA Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities dataset includes facilities 
  that provide out-of-home psychiatric care to children, adolescents, and young adults in a 
  non-hospital, highly structured setting. When possible, efforts were made to confirm 
  the rooftop location of each psychiatric residential treatment facility. The 
  accuracy of geocoding is available in Geocoding Certainty attribute field 
  (Geocoding Certainty: Rooftop="00", Street="01", Zip Centroid="04", Not geocoded="99").'

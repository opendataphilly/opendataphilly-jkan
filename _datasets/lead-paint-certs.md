notes: "The Philadelphia Lead Paint Disclosure and Certification Law requires owners of property built before 1978 
  to provide a certification that a property is lead free or lead safe before it may be rented to a tenant (either 
  a new or renewed lease, formal or informal). This certification (or statement of exemption) must be submitted to 
  the Lead and Healthy Homes Program through the [Lead Certification Submission System](https://leadcertification.phila.gov/login)
  a requirement to obtain a rental license. This dataset provides the current certification status of each property 
  in the city by OPA account number, based on the information submitted to the Lead and Healthy Homes Program. Note 
  that the certification information must be consistent with the details of the rental license in order for the rental 
  license to be granted."

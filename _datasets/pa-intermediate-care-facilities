notes: 'The PA Intermediate Care Facilities dataset includes facilities where 
care is provided to acute care patients who are medically stable but too unstable 
to be treated in alternative healthcare settings such as home, ambulatory, or 
traditional skilled long term care. When possible, efforts were made to confirm the 
rooftop location of each intermediate care facility. The accuracy of geocoding is 
available in Geocoding Certainty attribute field (Geocoding Certainty: Rooftop="00", 
Street="01", Zip Centroid="04", Not geocoded="99").'

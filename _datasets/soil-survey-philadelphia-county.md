notes: "A digital soil survey and generally is the most detailed level of soil 
  geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey.
  The dataset consists of geo-referenced digital maps and attribute data, and it includes 
  an optional special soil features map layer for features too small to delineate at the 
  mapping scale but large and contrasting enough to significantly influence land 
  use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System
  relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties."

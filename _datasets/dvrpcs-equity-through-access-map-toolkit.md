notes: As part of the Equity Through Acesss project, DVRPC created the ETA Map Toolkit
  and Priority Score. This interactive web-based tool demonstrates concentrations
  of need and opportunity, as well as disparities in access to essential health services
  like hospitals, health clinics, recreational spaces, senior centers, and more in
  the Greater Philadelphia region. Users can view layers representing different datasets
  including distributions of vulnerable populations, the locations of essential services,
  and areas where transit access is low. These three variables were combined to create
  the Priority Score map, which visualizes areas where new public transit connections
  could be made, changed, or improved to bridge access gaps in the future.

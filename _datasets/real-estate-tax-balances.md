notes: "Data about real estate accounts with tax balances. The aggregated datasets include both accounts with overdue balances  (property owner owes a late balance in the current tax year but it is not yet considered delinquent) and tax delinquencies. Tax delinquencies are accounts with outstanding balances for previous tax years. A past due account becomes delinquent when the real estate tax is still unpaid on January 1 of the following year that the tax was due."

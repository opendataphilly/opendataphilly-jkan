notes: "From the Streets Department snow emergency route page\r\n\r\nWhen snow accumulations\
  \ approach emergency status, the Managing Director may declare a snow emergency.\
  \ Once emergency status is declared, the City's 110 miles of Snow Emergency Routes\
  \ receive priority. Owners of vehicles and dumpsters must move them to alternate\
  \ parking spaces so City forces can clear snow from curb-to-curb on the emergency\
  \ routes. Any vehicle remaining on a Snow Emergency Route during the declared Snow\
  \ Emergency will be ticketed and towed. If your car is towed, call 215-686-SNOW\
  \ for its location. Do NOT call 911.\r\nThe snow-emergency-routes.csv file was created\
  \ from the table on the Streets Department snow emergency route page. I used this\
  \ file to generate the snow-emergency-route-segment-ids.csv file.\r\n\r\nThe snow-emergency-route-segment-ids.csv\
  \ file contains the IDs of all of the street segments that are classified as snow\
  \ emergency routes. The snow emergency routes shapefile/geojson is built by filtering\
  \ the street centerline layer to include only those rows where the seg_id is contained\
  \ in this list."

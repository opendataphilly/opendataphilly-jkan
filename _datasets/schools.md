notes: "Data includes points identifying public schools, charter schools, many private\
  \ schools, school annexes, and athletic fields and facilities. The types of data\
  \ were extended from previous schools layers in order to assist the Streets Department\
  \ in their school signage and crosswalk initiatives.  \r\n\r\n__The schools layer\
  \ provides information on public, private, charter and archdiocesan schools. Please\
  \ keep in mind that this data, particularly with regards to enrollment, is constantly\
  \ changing or is not publicly available. If you have specific questions about a\
  \ school, please contact that facility directly.__\r\n\r\n"

  The PA Nursing Homes dataset includes facilities for people who don't need to 
  be in a hospital but can't be cared for at home. When possible, efforts were made 
  to confirm the rooftop location of each nursing home. The accuracy of geocoding is 
  available in Geocoding Certainty attribute field (Geocoding Certainty: Rooftop="00", 
  Street="01", Zip Centroid="04", Not geocoded="99").

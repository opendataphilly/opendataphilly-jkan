notes: "Overview:\r\nThe School Progress Report (SPR) is an innovative tool designed\
  \ to help us support, respond to, and improve our schools. The SPR reflects our\
  \ core belief that all students deserve to attend great schools and that we must\
  \ hold ourselves to a standard of equitable educational excellence. The SPR enables\
  \ us to both see whether we are meeting this standard, and to track progress and\
  \ growth of students against the District\u2019s anchor goals (outlined in Action\
  \ Plan).\r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n\u2022 The SPR looks at schools across multiple\
  \ dimensions, reflecting and appreciating the richness and complexity of the educational\
  \ experience\r\n\u2022 Among these dimensions, the SPR puts the most emphasis on\
  \ student growth, reflecting our focus on and commitment to ensuring that all of\
  \ our students are learning\r\n\u2022 The SPR includes useful comparisons within\
  \ \u201Cpeer group\u201D schools that are serving similar student populations\r\n\
  \u2022 The SPR is a local management tool that is designed to be both fair and actionable\
  \ across District and Charter Schools\r\n\r\nPurpose and Use:\r\n\u2022 To identify\
  \ and celebrate successes\r\n\u2022 To identify areas needing interventions and\
  \ supports\r\n\u2022 To enable evidence-based decisions about intervention, replication,\
  \ renewal, and expansion\r\n\u2022 To strategically focus resources for greatest\
  \ impact on students\r\n\u2022 To track progress against the Action Plan anchor\
  \ goals"

notes: "The datasets below have been archived and will not receive further updates,\
  \ but remain available for reference. The up-to-date and more comprehensive [Neighborhood\
  \ Food Retail data](https://www.opendataphilly.org/datasets/neighborhood-food-retail)\
  \ is available and will be updated annually going forward. For those conducting\
  \ analysis using this data, please be advised that the previous methodology is vastly\
  \ different from the more recent data, so it would not make sense to compare the\
  \ two.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is derived from the Walkable Access to Healthy Foods\
  \ in Philadelphia, 2012-2014 report analyses."

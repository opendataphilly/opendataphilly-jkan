notes: 'An online parking facility information and look-up tool developed by the Philadelphia
  Parking Authority (PPA) for the Center City and University City areas. Users browse
  preselected popular destinations/neighborhoods or enter an address in either areas
  to explore corresponding parking entries, represented as different feature points
  on a map. Specific parking information includes PPA facilities, private facilities,
  and popular destination markers. Clicking on each location-point, yields information
  about different rates, type of facility (garage/lot), total spaces, distance to
  entered destination, and operator name. '

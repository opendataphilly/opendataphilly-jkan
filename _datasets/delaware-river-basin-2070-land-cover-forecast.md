notes: "DRB2070 Version 1.0 represents a baseline forecast of urban land cover in\
  \ the Delaware River Basin (DRB) out to the year 2070. It was developed by the Delaware\
  \ River Basin Land Use Dynamics Project at Shippensburg Unviersity. The forecasts\
  \ were developed using a SLEUTH urban growth model for the 43 county region of the\
  \ DRB over the 2001-2006 time period. The model was validated for the 2006-2011\
  \ time period. The modeling team used the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) urban\
  \ classes to represent urban land cover as developed or not developed. The DRB was\
  \ subdivided into eight modeling subregions in order to improve the quality of the\
  \ modeling. Additional information is available at:\r\n\r\n - https://drbproject.org/drb2070-version-1/\r\

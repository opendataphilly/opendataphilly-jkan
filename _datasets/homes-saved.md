notes: "To prevent homeowners from becoming homeless due to foreclosure, the City\
  \ initiated the Residential Mortgage Foreclosure Prevention Program, an innovative\
  \ program that links a Court of Common Pleas order requiring that homeowners facing\
  \ foreclosure have an opportunity to meet with their lenders to negotiate an alternative\
  \ to foreclosure with City-funded housing counseling, outreach, a hotline and legal\
  \ assistance. Working together, the City and the Court have created and implemented\
  \ a national model.\r\n\r\nTrouble downloading or have questions about this City\

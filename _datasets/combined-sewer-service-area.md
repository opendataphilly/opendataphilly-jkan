  \ class named modelsheds. The polygons in this layer are catchments for sanitary,\
  \ storm and/or combined sewer flows. These catchments are used in the hydraulic\
  \ models. Data DevelopmentBase Modelsheds are maintained regularly and delineate\
  \ waste water and stormwater and combined sewer catchments in Philadelphia. Storm\
  \ water and waste water pipe flow are analyzed to delineate the shed boundaries."

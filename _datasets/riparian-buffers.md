notes: 'Areas of stream bank sections (including main stem, tributaries and small
  head water streams) lacking a riparian buffer, or vegetated strip that protects
  from the impact of adjacent land uses. Locations are identified as lacking either
  one or both of the following conditions: 50'' wide or more forest and at least 50%
  canopy closure. Data originates from the Heritage Conservancy Assessment, funded
  by the PA department of Environmental Protection''s Coastal Zone Management and
  Pennsylvania Stream ReLeaf programs. For the followup work in 2012, only three counties
  were completed with Heritage Conservancy performing the work in
  Philadelphia and Bucks counties, and Montgomery County mapped by the county.'

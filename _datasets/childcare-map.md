notes: "Childcare Map helps Philadelphians make decisions about childcare.\r\n\r\n\
  Collection Process: TRF culled childcare data for the City of Philadelphia from\
  \ various sources, and incorporated data from the Census related to demographics,\
  \ income, poverty, and transportation. TRF also gathered overlays of various city\
  \ boundaries from OpenDataPhilly and other local sources. More information on sources\
  \ is available at http://www.policymap.com/files/ChildcareMapDataDirectory.pdf.\r\
  \n\r\nData Purpose:  TRF collected the data to provide as clear a picture as possible\
  \ of the supply of and demand for childcare in the city, and to better understand\
  \ where the gaps are so that stakeholders can work to address them.\r\nIntended\
  \ Audience:  Childcare providers, investors, policy makers, and parents.\r\nWhy\
  \ Collected:  High-quality childcare supports positive child development and prepares\
  \ children for success in school and beyond.  As such, accessing high-quality care\
  \ is important for the well-being of neighborhoods and families.  By identifying\
  \ areas where shortages of high-quality childcare exist, policymakers and investors\
  \ can work towards increasing access for all."

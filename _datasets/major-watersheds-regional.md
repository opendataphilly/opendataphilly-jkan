notes: "Polygon feature class representing major watersheds in Philadelphia. Data\
  \ was developed originally from either USGS and the 2004 Sanborn DEM (digital elevation\
  \ model) using ArcHydro watershed extraction tools. Major Watersheds are dissolved\
  \ from subshed boundaries which reflect surface flow in relationship to stormwater\
  \ inlets and outfalls.\r\n\r\n"

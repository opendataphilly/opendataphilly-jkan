notes: "Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) data clipped to Philadelphia. Please note, FEMA is moving away from solely using '100-year' and '500-year'
  flood terminology by emphasizing the more accurate and technical phrase '1-percent annual chance flood' for a 100-year flood and '0.2-percent annual chance flood'
  for a 500-year flood, focusing on the probability of occurrence rather than the time frame implied by the 'year' designation."

notes: "The streets (at the center of platystreet blocks) involved in the PPR Playstreets\
  \ Program.  This program closes designated streets to traffic so that kids have\
  \ a safe place to play when school is out. A key feature of the program are the\
  \ nutritious meals and snacks provided to children. This is important during the\
  \ summer months when school meals are not available.\r\n\r\n"

notes: "The Reinvestment Fund’s (TRF) Market Value Analysis (MVAs) is a tool residents and policymakers can use to identify and understand
  the elements of their local real estate markets. It is an objective, data driven tool built on local administrative data and validated
  with local experts. With an MVA, public officials and private actors can more precisely target intervention strategies in stressed
  markets and support sustainable growth in stronger markets. [Visit TRF's MVA analysis](https://www.reinvestment.com/research/market-value-analysis/)
  page for more information."

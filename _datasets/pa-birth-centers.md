notes: 'The PA Birth Centers includes the locations of birth facilities in Pennsylvania. 
A birth center is a medical facility, specializing in childbirth, 
that is less restrictive and more homelike than a hospital. When possible, efforts 
were made to confirm the rooftop location of each birth facility. The accuracy of 
geocoding is available in Geocoding Certainty attribute field (Geocoding Certainty: 
Rooftop="00", Street="01", Zip Centroid="04", Not geocoded="99").'

notes: "The Complete Streets Layer combines the Street Types developed by the City\
  \ Planning Commission\u2019s Pedestrian and Bicycle Plan, with the Complete Streets\
  \ Handbook of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Transportation and Utilities. It allows\
  \ developers, planners, engineers and community groups to easily identify their\
  \ street type and associated pedestrian, bicycle and other travel priorities to\
  \ be included during the planning of new streets or large developments.\r\n\r\n\

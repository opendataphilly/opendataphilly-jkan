  Identification will be required to receive a test. If you don’t have health insurance,
  you may still be able to receive a test by paying out-of-pocket. Some sites may also:
   - Limit testing to people who meet certain criteria.
   - Require an appointment.
   - Require a referral from your doctor.

  Check a location’s specific details on the map. Then, call or visit the provider’s website before going for a test."

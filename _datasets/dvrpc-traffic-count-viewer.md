notes: 'Traffic Count Viewer is an online mapping application, which users can use
  to explore traffic count reports in different locations within the Delaware Valley,
  including Philadelphia. Users search by location (address, city, zip code, or place
  name) to view point features on the interactive mapping visualization of traffic
  records. Clicking on a point of interest or grouping multiple points on the map
  yields traffic count information tables, which includes: Date of Counnt ; DVRPC
  File # ; Type ; Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) ; Municipality ; Route Number
  ; Road Name ; Count Direction ; and From/To Locations, as well as a link to the
  detailed (hourly) report. Data tables are exportable as .CSV and detailed reports
  are available for export in multiple formats (including basic .doc and .rtf outputs.)
  Traffic count data is collected by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission
  and other agencies. '

notes: "***As of May 2022, these datasets moved from daily updates to weekly updates\
  \ every Monday.***\r\n\r\n**For greatest accuracy, please use the latest dataset\
  \ for all analysis and reporting as opposed to any data you downloaded prior to\
  \ September 29, 2020. All datasets now reflect counts from test collection dates\
  \ instead of the previously displayed result dates. To keep things clear, the field\
  \ name in the COVID Outcome by Date files also changed from 'Result_Date' to 'CollectionDate.'\
  \  These changes will adjust, for example, the count of cases for each day. PDPH\
  \ has also added 376 confirmed COVID-19 cases (positive tests) that were previously\
  \ missing from the data.**\r\n\r\nDeidentified, aggregate datasets showing COVID\
  \ tests by date, zip, and outcome and cases by race, age or sex.  To protect the\
  \ confidentiality of residents, PDPH suppresses the exact data for any categories\
  \ that have less than 6 counts (i.e. of tests or fatalities).\r\n\r\n"

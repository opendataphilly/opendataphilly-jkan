notes: "BACKGROUND - The objective of geotechnical testing is to help determine the\
  \ suitability of a site for green stormwater infrastructure. The tests are used\
  \ to calculate infiltration rates at proposed green infrastructure locations and\
  \ evaluate the lithology at depths sufficient to identify any hydraulically limiting\
  \ layers that would inhibit vertical infiltration and potentially cause lateral\
  \ flow. The testing includes drilling borings followed by infiltration testing within\
  \ the footprint of each GSI system.\r\n\r\nUSING THE LAYER - The infiltration rates\
  \ and subsurface lithology results such as depth to bedrock and depth to groundwater\
  \ may be helpful for other users of this layer, but it is important to note that\
  \ these values can vary widely from location to location, even for nearby sites."

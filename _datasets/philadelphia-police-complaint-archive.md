notes: "Late last year, the City of Philadelphia began posting online certain data\
  \ about civilian complaints against the Philadelphia Police Department. The City\
  \ will only make these data available on a five-year rolling basis, however. The\
  \ Declaration's Philadelphia Police Accountability Project will be hosting a publicly\
  \ available archive of the same data to provide Philadelphia residents with a fuller\
  \ picture of police discipline without five year limits.\r\n\r\nThe Complaints Against\
  \ Police archived data include the allegations in each separate complaint. The CAP\
  \ Complainants archived data include details about individuals filing complaints.\
  \ The CAP Findings archived data include the final disposition of complaints.\r\n\
  \r\nThe City updates the CAP data once per month. The months on the resources below\
  \ indicate the month that the files in question were uploaded by the City. In other\
  \ words, the file labeled \"Complaints Against Police March 2018 Data\" was uploaded\
  \ by the City in March 2018 before being replaced the next month.\r\n\r\nThe original\
  \ data are available here: https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/police-complaints"

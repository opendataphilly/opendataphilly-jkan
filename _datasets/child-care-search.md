notes: Child Care Search is a searchable database, which yields results on child care
  services suited to parameters first of child age, then desired program focus, and
  finally by location (county). Users follow step-by-step input instructions to create
  a center/institute profile type, which the database tool then tries to match most
  closely. In addition to location and contact information, qualitative information
  about care centers (STAR rating system ran) are also available. All information
  results are freely viewable and printable, but not exportable.

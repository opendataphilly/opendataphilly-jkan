notes: Mid-century modern architecture and buildings of the recent past are enjoying
  a resurgence of appreciation and interest nationwide, but here in Philadelphia,
  our eclectic collection of postwar buildings is often overlooked. To help identify
  and celebrate these emerging landmarks, the Preservation Alliance is compiling a
  list of notable structures built within the city between 1945 and 1980. The inclusion
  of a building in this inventory does not imply endorsement of it for designation
  or other purposes, nor does its absence imply a lack of significance. Rather, the
  list is meant to illustrate the breadth and depth of design from an era often overshadowed
  by earlier periods and styles.

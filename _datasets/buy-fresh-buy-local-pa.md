notes: Buy Fresh, Buy Local is an online application that enables users to access
  locations and information on the network of PA local farmers and locally grown food
  products. Users enter an address or zipcode to explore relevant information (proximity,
  contact, hours of operation) of nearby farms, farmers markets, as well as restaurants,
  wineries/breweries, retail stores and other venues that feature seasonal and/or
  locally grown food products. Results are also displayed as interactive points on
  a map visualization. The application is maintained by the Pennsylvania Association
  for Sustainable Agriculture. Free registration enables commenting, blogging, uploading
  recipes and other interactive features.

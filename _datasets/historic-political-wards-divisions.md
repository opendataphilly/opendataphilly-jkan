notes: 'Election results are published at the Ward and Ward-Division levels.
  However, wards and ward divisions are adjusted on an ongoing bsais, and in order to
  map historic election results, it is necessary to have ward divisions that match
  the boundaries in effect at the time of the election.
  Historic ward and ward division boundary data are from PASDA, Azavea, and Robert Cheetham archives.
  In addition, some results from open records requests to teh City of Philadelphia.
  Data has been collected for 2003 to 2020.
  Attribute tables were modified to match across all years.'

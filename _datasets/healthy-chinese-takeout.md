notes: "Healthy Chinese Takeout participants as of 2/5/15. The Philadelphia Healthy\
  \ Chinese Take-out Initiative is working to prevent and control high blood pressure\
  \ in Philadelphia residents by 1) reducing the sodium content in Chinese take-out\
  \ dishes by 10-15% and 2) decreasing access to tobacco products. The initiative\
  \ is a joint effort among Temple University\u2019s Center for Asian Health, the\
  \ Asian Community Health Coalition, the Philadelphia Chinese Restaurant Association,\
  \ and the Philadelphia Department of Public Health. Excess consumption of sodium\
  \ (salt) and tobacco use are two major contributors to hypertension, heart disease\
  \ and stroke. Chinese take-out restaurant dishes can have large amounts of sodium\
  \ mainly due to the sauces used in preparation and cooking. And Chinese take-out\
  \ restaurants tend to have higher rates of illegal tobacco sales to minors than\
  \ other retailers. To date, 200 Chinese take-out restaurants have enrolled in the\
  \ initiative, participated in a low-sodium healthy cooking training with a professional\
  \ chef, and received education about complying with the Tobacco Youth Sales Law.\

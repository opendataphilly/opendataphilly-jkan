notes: 'The PA Community Mental Health Centers a database of facilities that provide 
prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation mental health service, sometimes organized 
as a practical alternative to the largely custodial care given in mental hospitals. 
When possible, efforts were made to confirm the rooftop location of each community mental 
health center. The accuracy of geocoding is available in Geocoding Certainty attribute field 
(Geocoding Certainty: Rooftop="00", Street="01", Zip Centroid="04", Not geocoded="99").'

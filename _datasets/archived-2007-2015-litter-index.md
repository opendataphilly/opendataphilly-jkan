notes: "The datasets below have been archived and will not receive further updates,\
  \ but remain available for reference.  The up-to-date and more comprehensive [Litter\
  \ Index is available here](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/litter-index)\
  \ and will be updated annually going forward. For those conducting analysis using\
  \ Litter Index data, please be advised that the survey design between the 2007-\
  \ 2015 data is vastly different from the 2017 data, so it would not make sense to\
  \ compare the two. \r\n\r\nThe Litter Index is used to compare the relative cleanliness\
  \ of different areas of the city of Philadelphia.  \r\n\r\nTrouble downloading or\
  \ have questions about this City dataset? Visit the [OpenDataPhilly Discussion Group](http://www.phila.gov/data/discuss/)"

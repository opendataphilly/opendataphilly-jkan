  The TrainView API returns information on all current regional rail trains.
<br><br>
  The NextToArrive API returns departure and arrival times between two different stations.
  Please refer to the Regional Rail Inputs page (see below) to see all valid inputs.
<ul>
 <li>req1 is the starting Regional Rail station</li>
 <li>req2 is the ending Regional Rail station</li>
 <li>req3 is an integer with the number of results to show</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
  The Arrival/Departure API returns a list/queue of regional rail trains to arrive at a station in two/both directions.
  The direction is demarcated as either Northbound or Southbound. The directions are obviously
  not geographical references, but rather a reference to the old Reading and Pennsy Railroads.
  The key to understanding the direction is by using Suburban Station as a starting point:
  Any trains that move eastbound towards Market East are all considered Northbound; trains
  going from suburban t o 30th St are all Southbound. The path field describes more accurately
  the path of travel along various branches. Every regional stop is a valid parameter.
  Please refer to the Regional Rail Inputs page (see below) to see all valid inputs.

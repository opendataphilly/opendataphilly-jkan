  \ dating back to the 1850s and can be searched by geographic criteria such as address,\
  \ intersection, place name, and neighborhood as well as keyword, date, collection,\
  \ topics, and other criteria. Images and maps are associated with a location using\
  \ the database's geocoding feature. Users can create a free account to save images,\

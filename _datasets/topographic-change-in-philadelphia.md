notes: 'A scope of work was developed in response to a request by the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District. The request was to perform a
topographic change grid analysis for the Frankford 7.5-minute quadrangle,
1:24,000-scale topographic map, which includes the Wissinoming neighborhood, and
the Germantown 7.5-minute quadrangle, which includes the Logan and Feltonville
neighborhoods of the City of Philadelphia. The following tasks were performed under
this scope of work: A GPS-corrected GIS grid analysis for each quadrangle was
completed and is accompanied by documentation that describes
procedures and provides metadata of the informational content of the GIS. A
high-resolution global positioning system (GPS) survey was conducted for each
topographic quadrangle in order to evaluate and correct systematic discrepancies in
elevation between the modern and historic surveys. Prior to release, the fully
 documented GPS-corrected GIS grid analysis for each quadrangle was reviewed for
(1) com-pleteness of documentation and for (2) appropriate analysis and discussion
of uncertainties. The following report is in fulfillment of the tasks outlined in
this scope of work and was performed by the U. S. Geological Survey for the U. S.
Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District under MIPR agreement number: W25PHS93358288.'

notes: "This layer delineates the fifty-six sections of the Highway Division of the\
  \ City of Philadelphia Streets Department. Sections can be aggregated into districts\
  \ and subdivided into subsections. A Highway Engineer is responsible for each district.\
  \ The section layer was developed to aid the Highway Division in the planning, organizing,\
  \ and maintaining of the streets within each of the six districts. Examples of maintenance\
  \ include: paving, snow removal, concrete maintenance, and the monitoring/repairing\
  \ of ditches and potholes.\r\n\r\n"

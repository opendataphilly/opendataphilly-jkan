notes: "Founded as William Penn's \"Holy Experiment,\" Philadelphia has a centuries-long\
  \ history of fostering and constructing prominent houses of worship throughout the\
  \ city. In recent decades, as congregations face declining membership and shifting\
  \ neighborhood demographics, these historically- and architecturally-significant\
  \ properties have often suffered from deferred maintenance, insensitive alterations,\
  \ and partial or complete demolition.\r\n\r\nAdvocacy organizations like the Preservation\
  \ Alliance for Greater Philadelphia and Partners for Sacred Places have focused\
  \ on this issue for years, highlighting the threats to Philadelphia's neighborhoods\
  \ and communities if these structures continue to be abandoned or lost. Over the\
  \ summer of 2011, in order to more fully understand and address the issue, the Preservation\
  \ Alliance partnered with Philadelphia Historical Commission and Partners for Sacred\
  \ Places to develop a comprehensive index of historic churches covering the entire\
  \ city. Compiling, verifying, and updating data from a number of different sources,\
  \ University of Pennsylvania graduate student Molly Lester assembled a database\
  \ which includes every purpose-built house of worship constructed in the city before\
  \ 1960.\r\n\r\nData elements include:  current congregation, original congregation,\
  \ address, year of construction, original architect and whether or not the build\
  \ is on the Philadelphia or National Historic Registers.\r\n"

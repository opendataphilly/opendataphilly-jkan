notes: 'An online application, which enables users to view calculated walkability
  ranks and related neighborhood metrics, such as proximity of nearby businesses,
  service providers, and recreational/outdoor spaces. Users can select geographic
  parameters (neighborhood names), or search for specific locations (addresses), to
  access mobility data, which is also visualized on a heat map tool with marked features.
  In addition to walkability, the application also gauges biking and transit scores,
  which measure the convenience/proximity to bikability and public transit opportunities.
  Users can also access walking, biking, and transit score through an API.  More information
  about the Walk Score is available [through Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/how-walk-score-works). '

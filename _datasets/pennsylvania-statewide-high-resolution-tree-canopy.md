notes: "This dataset maps tree canopy for the state Pennsylvania at a 1m resolution.\
  \ The dataset was developed from publicly available LiDAR data, which was acquired\
  \ in 2006, 2007, and 2008. LiDAR data was supplemented with leaf-on imagery acquired\
  \ in 2010 through the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP).\r\n\r\nUVM Spatial\
  \ Analysis Lab request attribution in any publications, reports, derivative datasets,\
  \ etc.   Please note that this dataset is independent from those areas we have mapped\
  \ for Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) assessments.  Future releases will integrate these\
  \ two projects."

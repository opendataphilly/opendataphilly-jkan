   inspires people to create a better future through historical understanding. One
   of the oldest historical societies in the United States, it is home to some 600,000
   printed items and more than 21 million manuscript and graphic items. Its unparalleled
   collections encompass more than 350 years of America's history from
   its 17th-century origins to the contributions of its most recent immigrants. The
   society's remarkable holdings together with its educational programming make
   it one of the nation's most important special collections libraries: a center
   of historical documentation and study, education, and engagement. https://hsp.org/"

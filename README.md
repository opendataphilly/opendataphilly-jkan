# OpenDataPhilly

[OpenDataPhilly](https://opendataphilly.org/) is a regional open data catalog, providing a repository for information about open data available from the City of Philadelphia, non-profit organizations, university research projects, and other publishers of open data about the region.
While most open data catalogs are maintained by a single government entity, we believe that a diverse array of open data is more useful to the community than many repositories with discrete collections. Up to this point, ODP has relied on pro bono support from single organizations (Azavea and Element 84); in the long run, we seek to grow the project's community of contributors in order to improve its resilience and sustainability, while still maintaining its regional character.
